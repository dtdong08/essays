I have always wanted to be a developer. I have researched it and know how to do it. However, I do not think many teenagers know how to get their dream jobs. Let me tell you about mine and how I am going to get it. I hope this will help other people to get their own dream jobs.

The first thing I need is a university degree in computer science. This degree tells people I know how to develop programs. It will teach me how to use programming languages to create useful programs. I think all developers need this. Another thing I need is to gain work experience at different companies to understand the industry better. Last but not least, I need a good command of English to read documentation and use tools written in English, no matter how much I hate the language.

I have decided to study computer science at the University of Engineering and Technology in Ha Noi (if possible) to get my degree. I am going to work over the holidays while I am at university to gain work experience. I have studied, am studying, and will continue to study English from my very learned English teacher to improve my English.

These are the three most important things I think I need to do to get my dream job. Hopefully, after reading this, you can start to plan for your dream job.
